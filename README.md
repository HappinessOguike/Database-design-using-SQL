# Database-design-using-SQL
**Designed a database to compare child wellbeing in developing countries**
Data realized from the Young Live project have been processed and integrated into the charity's 
Child Wellbeing Monitor, a reporting tool for child poverty analysis to better understand the root 
causes and effects of childhood poverty in low-income nations for effective child welfare 
interventions and influence the formulation of future policy. 
The huge datasets have been broken down into views and tables to aid effective information 
interpretation. Several database features have also been introduced to assure data integrity, 
security, concurrence, and other variables that contribute to the systemâ€™s overall effectiveness.
